### 🧱 What is Geotechnical Engineering?

Geotechnical engineering is the branch of civil engineering concerned with the behaviour of **soils, rocks, and groundwater** under loading, construction, and environmental conditions. Essentially:  
> **How does the ground affect our ability to build on it?**

---

### 🔍 Key Areas in Geotechnics

#### **🕳 Tunnelling**
My undergraduate thesis focused on tunnelling. It involves understanding how the ground reacts to excavations, including settlement, face stability, and long-term ground behaviour — especially in soft clays.

#### **⛰ Slope Stability**
The resistance of natural or man-made slopes (soil or rock) to sliding or collapse. It’s essential to ensure slope safety, particularly under loading or during rainfall.

#### **🪜 Piles & Foundations**
Used when surface soils are too weak to support loads. Piles are deep foundations designed based on ground conditions and can work through end bearing or shaft friction.

#### **🧱 Retaining Walls**
Walls built to hold back soil — commonly used in basements, cuttings, and embankments. Design must account for:
- Lateral earth pressures (e.g. Rankine or Coulomb)
- Water pressure (pore pressure)
- Surcharges

#### **🪢 Soil Reinforcement**
Improving soil stability using materials like **geogrids**, **soil nails**, or **rock bolts**. A common design reference in the UK is:
> **BS 8006-1:2010** – Strengthened/reinforced soils and other fills.

#### **☣ Contaminated Land**
Contaminated sites require careful assessment and design of countermeasures. Engineers may:
- Develop a **Conceptual Site Model (CSM)**
- Predict contaminant **seepage using advection–dispersion equations**
- Use **slurry walls** or **cut-off barriers**

## 🧠 Conceptual Site Models (CSMs)

A **Conceptual Site Model (CSM)** is a structured way of describing the **environmental and geotechnical conditions of a site**, focusing on **how contamination might travel** and **who or what might be affected**.

It forms the foundation for **risk assessment** and guides **site investigation and design**.

---

### 🔗 Source–Pathway–Receptor Model

The CSM is typically built around this simple structure:

| Element   | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Source**    | Where the contamination originates (e.g. fuel spill, arsenic in made ground) |
| **Pathway**   | How the contaminant moves (e.g. through groundwater, soil vapour) |
| **Receptor**  | What or who could be harmed (e.g. construction workers, groundwater, ecosystems) |

💡 **Contamination only poses a risk if there is a complete Source → Pathway → Receptor (SPR) linkage.**

---

### 🧭 When is a CSM Used?

CSMs are used throughout site development, particularly for **brownfield sites** or areas with a history of industrial use.

- Site planning and risk management
- Design of remediation or containment (e.g. slurry walls)
- Regulatory reporting and planning permission

---

### 📝 How to Build a CSM

1. **Desk Study / Preliminary Risk Assessment (Phase 1)**
   - Review maps, historical land use, geology, hydrogeology
   - Identify potential contaminants

2. **Site Walkover**
   - Look for evidence of pollution, ground disturbance, venting, staining

3. **Intrusive Investigation (Phase 2)**
   - Boreholes, trial pits, groundwater and gas monitoring
   - Soil and water sampling

4. **Conceptual Model Development**
   - Combine all data into a visual or tabular model
   - Highlight possible contaminant transport and exposure scenarios

---

### 🧪 Example: Arsenic-Contaminated Site

| Component   | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **Source**     | Arsenic in made ground (historic industrial waste) |
| **Pathway**    | Downward migration via groundwater flow |
| **Receptor**   | Underlying clean soil, construction workers, groundwater aquifer |
| **Barriers**   | Capping layer, slurry wall (mechanical containment) |

Visualising this helps decide whether intervention is needed — e.g. to install a cut-off wall or monitor groundwater.

### 📉 Why CSMs Matter in Geotechnics

Even if you're not remediating a chemical spill, **CSMs help manage geotechnical risk**:
- Identify **soft zones** or **compressible layers**
- Understand **groundwater influence** on retaining walls and slopes
- Prevent costly surprises during excavation

> “You can’t manage risk if you don’t understand it. That’s what a CSM is for.”

Next: We'll cover **Darcy's Law and seepage analysis**, the key tool for predicting how water and contaminants actually move.
