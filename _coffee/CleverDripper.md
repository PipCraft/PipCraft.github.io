Since I got a cleverdripper in December, I have not used another brewer more. I will always love my Aeropress and a V60, or even a moka pot. But the clever dripper is just such a wonderful brewer, simple and reliable, while also letting me brew half a litre. Not quite the absolute versatility of an Aeropress. But it is such a great brewer.
