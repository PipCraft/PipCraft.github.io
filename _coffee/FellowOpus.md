I got my Fellow Opus as a Christmas present. Being my first serious piece of coffee equipment (at least in terms of price), I obviously went into using it with rose-tinted glasses.

But after using it for months, I would say those rose-tinted glasses are just reality.

It is not perfect. I agree with the common criticism that the Opus is not as premium as some grinders, and it has static problems (requiring frustrating cleanup). The adjustment mechanism is not perfect but works well enough — especially as I mainly use it around a few settings and don't push it to espresso, for example.

Compared to the Hario Slim (or whatever that thing is called) I was using before, it is a transformative difference. Yes, hand grinding has its charm...  
But not every morning for years.

Being able to consistently grind any size in seconds with little effort and just some noise is amazing compared to hand grinding — especially with a cheap hand grinder.  
Don't get me started on grinding for large batches such as cold brew, which was a nightmare on my hand grinder.

I recommend the Opus for its value and performance.
