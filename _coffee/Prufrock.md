Prufrock is a neat, modern café nestled on Leather Lane, and it’s been a haunt of mine for many years now. Since moving to London in ’21, I really got into coffee as a serious hobby (including, regrettably, some snobbery).

To give myself some credit though — I didn’t discover Prufrock until some years later. Obviously, being a coffee nerd, I knew about James Hoffmann, but didn’t realise he had his own coffee shop!

And it is, in many ways, everything you’d hope and expect:  
- Friendly staff  
- Excellent variety of coffee (including plenty of guest options)  
- A modern, warm interior (not another drab white café)

While some of my coffee colleagues find the friendly *free water service* from staff a bit much, I think it’s a charming novelty.

I’d recommend Prufrock for great coffee and food — but probably not for a five-hour study session, as it does get quite busy!

They’ve also got a nice selection of gear and merch for sale — worth a browse if you’re already spiralling down the rabbit hole like me.
