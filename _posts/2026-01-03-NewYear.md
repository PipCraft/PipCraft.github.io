Happy new year, While I won't apologise for not being self indulgent and blogging more in the later half of 2025, I do wish I did, However the rigmarole of University got in the way.
I have pushed myself harder than ever to be more engaged from the start in year 4, and that has certainly meant finding a new balance, but in 2026 that is just my plan. 
Not one for new years resolutions, I am not going to pretend I can set some arbitrary rules and become a more rounded person based on that, because ultimately life is more complex than that.
But I do like using the new year as a checkpoint to reflect on what I could have been better at last year, and time management (not leaving stuff till the last minute was that). 

I started 2026 much like I would start any year, at a party with some mates, but my mindset since has been one of cracking on, While I haven’t quashed every doom scrolling moment, I have managed to drop them down a lot, and while I still procrastinate (I am here writing this after all!) I have not done so as much, I have kept up the good habit of running, and not wasted as much time dreading going out for one. Bar a single assignment my early January is quiet, giving me breathing room to figure out a new normal that is productive and works for me as a person. 

Cheers to 2025 and I hope everyone has a good 2026
