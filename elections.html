            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>I have been a member of the student body since I first joined City in 2021 as a student rep. Since then, I was appointed to the assembly in 2022, and continued that role, winning an election for 2023. I have shown I have what it takes to be a valuable member of the student assembly.
            This year I have led the Debating Society as President, organising several events, including the very successful Great AI Debate, which you can <a href="https://blogs.city.ac.uk/learningatcity/2024/01/29/the-great-student-ai-debate/" class="highlighted-link">read more about here</a>. In my role, I have had to maintain a high level of organisation, managing communications and running a team, combined with the public speaking skills I have refined.
            As a member of the Assembly, I have fought consistently for more support during the cost of living crisis, being a member of the assembly when the university introduced the travel funding scheme.
            My experience in student politics will make me a valuable asset for the next elected assembly.</p>
